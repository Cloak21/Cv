    <h1>Computer Science Reflection</h1>
    <h2>Module 1 Reflection</h2>
    <h3>By demonstrating that all people cry, laugh, eat, worry, and die, it can introduce the idea that if we try and understand each other, we may even become friends. -Maya Angelou</h3>
    <p>People should be cooperative and we should work together and judge other people so quick. Society should more connected and people shouldn't be so separated. People should take some time to understand each other. You can't judge because you can lose a potential friend.</p>
