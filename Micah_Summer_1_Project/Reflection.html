     <h2>Reflection - 6/14/19</h2>
     <h3>When Brothers fight to the death. A stranger inherits their property. -African proverb</h3>
     <p>When we fight each other will take what we have. We get distracted by each other that the stuff around us we don’t notice. Don’t fight your brothers for stuff or a stranger will take it.</p>

      <h3>If you look at the people in your circle and don’t get inspired, then you don’t have a circle. You have a Cage. -Nipsey Hussle</h3>
      <p>You should be comfortable in your circle or that's not your circle. The people in your circle should be beneficial and you should know who’s in your circle. You shouldn't have toxic things in your circle.</p>

      <h3>If the Negro in the ghetto must eternally  be fed by the hand that pushes him in the ghetto, he will never become strong enough to get out of the ghetto. Carter G woodson</h3>

      <h3>By demonstrating that all people cry, laugh, eat, worry, and die, it can introduce the idea that if we try and understand each other, we may even become friends. -Maya Angelou</h3>
      <p>People should be cooperative and we should work together and judge other people so quick. Society should more connected and people shouldn't be so separated. People should take some time to understand each other. You can't judge because you can lose a potential friend.</p>

      <h3>The most disrespected woman in America is the black woman. The most unprotected woman in America is the black woman.The most neglected person in America is the Black women. -Malcom X</h3>
      <p>Black women are treated wrong because there women and there black. Black women don’t have a lot of rowmodels. They are also treated wrong by black men.</p>
