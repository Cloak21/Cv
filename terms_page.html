      <tr>
        <h1>Decomposition</h1>
        <li>Decomposition involves breaking down a complex problem or system into smaller parts that are more manageable and easier to understand. The smaller parts can then be examined and solved, or designed individually, as they are simpler to work with. If a problem is not decomposed, it is much harder to solve.</li>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <h1>Pattern Recognition </h1>
        <li>When we decompose a complex problem we often find patterns among the smaller problems we create. The patterns are similarities or characteristics that some of the problems share. Pattern recognition is one of the four cornerstones of Computer Science. It involves finding the similarities or patterns among small, decomposed problems that can help us solve more complex problems more efficiently.</li>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <h1>Abstraction</h1>
        <li>Abstraction is the process of filtering out – ignoring - the characteristics of patterns that we don't need in order to concentrate on those that we do. It is also the filtering out of specific details. From this we create a representation (idea) of what we are trying to solve. Abstraction allows us to create a general idea of what the problem is and how to solve it. The process instructs us to remove all specific detail, and any patterns that will not help us solve our problem. This helps us form our idea of the problem. This idea is known as a ‘model’.</li>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <h1>Algorithms</h1>
        <li>An algorithm is a plan, a set of step-by-step instructions to solve a problem. If you can tie shoelaces, make a cup of tea, get dressed or prepare a meal then you already know how to follow an algorithm.</li>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <h1>PseudoCode</h1>
        <li>Pseudocode is not a programming language, it is a simple way of describing a set of instructions that does not have to use specific syntax. Writing in pseudocode is similar to writing in a programming language. Each step of the algorithm is written on a line of its own in sequence. Usually, instructions are written in uppercase, variables in lowercase and messages in sentence case. In pseudocode, INPUT asks a question. OUTPUT prints a message on screen.</li>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <h1>Flow Charts </h1>
        <li>A flowchart is a diagram that represents a set of instructions. Flowcharts normally use standard symbols to represent the different instructions. There are few real rules about the level of detail needed in a flowchart. Sometimes flowcharts are broken down into many steps to provide a lot of detail about exactly what is happening. Sometimes they are simplified so that a number of steps occur in just one step.</li>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <h1>Evaluation & Debugging</h1>
        <li>Evaluation:

Computer performance evaluation is defined as the process by which a computer system's resources and outputs are assessed to determine whether the system is performing at an optimal level.




Debugging:
Errors in algorithms and code are called ‘bugs’, and the process of finding and fixing these is called ‘debugging’. Debugging can often take much longer than writing the code in the first place
</li>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <h1>Sequence, Selection & Repetition </h1>
        <li>Sequence:
 identifying a series of steps for a task
Selection:
In a selection structure, a question is asked, and depending on the answer, the program takes one of two courses of action, after which the program moves on to the next event.

Repetition:
 Repetition means repeating a sequence of instructions a certain number of times, or until some specific result is achieved</li>
